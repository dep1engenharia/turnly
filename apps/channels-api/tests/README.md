# Channels Api Test Suites

The test suite will allow you to easily test parts of this application with dynamic
data created by object mothers to reduce replication and show only cohesive attributes to the test.

### Getting Started

The list of commands will help you with the most common command variations,
but if you're missing something, you can refer to the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli) documentation.

**Unit**

Run only unit tests, they will usually be the fastest tests.

```sh
yarn devo channels-api test:unit
```

**Integration**

Run only integration tests, time to open the windows :D

```sh
yarn devo channels-api test:integration --runInBand
```

**Benchmark**

Run only benchmark tests, let's see how this is.

```sh
yarn devo channels-api test:benchmark
```

**e2e**

Run e2e tests. This command can be quite slow, so use it with caution.

```sh
yarn devo channels-api test:e2e
```

**Matches**

Run tests that match this spec name (match against the name in `describe` or `test`, basically).

When you are creating tests to some specific code, you may want only execute the tests that you're creating,
so you waste less time to verify your code. To do this, you can:

```sh
yarn devo channels-api test:unit -t name-of-test
```

**Watch mode**

Run tests related to git-based changed files with watch mode enabled.

```sh
# Only inside docker
yarn devo channels-api test:watch
```

**Coverage**

Run all the tests and get the coverage report.

```sh
yarn devo channels-api test:coverage
```
