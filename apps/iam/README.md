# Heimdall IAM — Identity & Access Management (SSO).

**Solving AAA**

We don't like to reinvent the wheel, we use Keycloak as an identity and access management solution.
This open-source project is our core for authentication, authorization and accounting.

Keycloak is a high performance Java-based identity and access management solution.
It lets developers add an authentication layer to their applications with minimum effort.
